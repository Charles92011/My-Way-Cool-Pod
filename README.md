# My-Way-Cool-Pod
A bare-minimum Adobe Connect Pod


It seems like every example of a Pod extension for Adobe Connect uses obfuscated javascript (includingthe examples for learning on the Adobe site), and/or include a flash component for compatibility with pre-html5 versions of Connect.

This example contains the smallest amount of code, all of which is in line with the HTML file, to make understanding it easier.

Simply zip up the contents of this repo and drop the zip file in a share Pod in Connect and it will work.
